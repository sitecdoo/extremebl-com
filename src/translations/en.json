    "question1": "What is climbing?",
    "question2": "Benefits of climbing?",
    "question3": "Can anyone climb?",
    "answer1": "Sport climbing is an increasingly popular form of recreation and sport, recently an Olympic sport, attracting people worldwide. It can be done on natural or artificial rocks, with two main types – bouldering, performed on lower rocks without ropes, and high rock climbing, which involves safety equipment like ropes. The goal is to successfully climb the set route, overcoming all its obstacles (known as 'cruxes'). This sport is accessible to people of all ages, from children to the elderly.",
    "answer2": "Sport climbing is a dynamic and exciting activity offering numerous physical and mental benefits, providing a physical challenge while also offering opportunities for socializing, traveling, and enjoying nature. It helps beginners overcome fear, improves coordination and focus, and builds strength and endurance for the whole body – often called modern gymnastics. For children, it aids in developing fine and gross motor skills, enhancing balance and movement awareness. Climbing also stimulates the production of hormones that reduce stress and increase feelings of satisfaction and fulfillment.",
    "answer3": "Yes, sport climbing is an activity that almost anyone can participate in, regardless of age or fitness level. Climbing routes vary in difficulty, ensuring there is always something suitable for beginners as well as challenges for more experienced climbers. However, people with certain health conditions, such as heart issues, joint problems, or balance difficulties, should consult a doctor before starting."

It can be performed on natural or artificial rocks, and there are two main types of climbing – bouldering, which takes place on lower rocks without ropes, and roped climbing, which involves using safety equipment like ropes.

      {
        "question": "Is sports climbing safe?",
        "answer": "Sports climbing is safe when using proper equipment and following safety rules. Rope protection, harnesses, and mats reduce the risk of injury. Most accidents occur due to inattention or poor technique, but with training and responsible climbing, this sport is safe and beneficial for the body and mind."
      },

        "question": "Do you need prior experience to engage in sports climbing?",
